# enotype

**A cross-language type library**

Available for JavaScript, PHP, Python and Ruby.

## Features

- Validation and conversion of `string` representations into language-native types.
- Implemented as a collection of minimalist functions, so called *loaders*.
- Zero-cost localization (currently `de`, `en`, `es`) through statically generated code.
- Generically usable in a multitude of contexts through a plain and simple design.
- Standard type library for the [eno notation language](https://eno-lang.org).
